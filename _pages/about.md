After living for the first 24 years of my life in India, I found my way to the United States in August 2021, where I am currently pursuing my **Master's degree** in Computer Science at **University of Maryland, Baltimore County**. This was something that was destined to happen, considering that I've spent so much time with computers for the last two decades. It was only over the last six years that I realized that I **love working with data**, which eventually took me down the path of **data science** and **machine learning**. And it is that very interest that drives me in pursuing projects, both personal and academic, related to these fields. At this point, I knew that it was only a matter of time before I zeroed in on higher education in the US, and so I eventually found my way to the computer science department at UMBC, where I now spend my time going into deeper waters of DS and ML, using academic projects as a way to get there.

For most of my life before the US, and all of my self-aware years, I lived in Hyderabad, a city that I call home. My academic career had a shaky start, because I found myself in the infamous engineering rat race in my teens, and didn't find my way to the top. However, in hindsight, that was for the best because it helped me discover and pursue things on my own terms, which is why you'll probably now see me at quizzes with a book or my trusty Kindle by my side, or at my desk working on random projects or participating in competitive coding events for fun.

What's in store for the future? Well, I will be graduating in May 2023, and am looking to work in positions that deal with data science or analysis, or work on machine learning related tasks. If you're interested in knowing more, you can visit the CV page or you can get in touch with me at my mail, and I'll be more than happy to reply.

**PS: "NC" is an abbreviation of my surname, and also a pretty handy nickname I had back in high school.**
