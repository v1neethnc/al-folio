[Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) is a yearly advent calendar for programming challenges, founded and maintained by Eric Wastl in 2015. There are 25 challenges each year, unveiled one per day in the first 25 days of December. My solution are written in Python 3. 

I personally enjoy the advent calendar quite a bit, so I'm really looking forward to finishing the entire archive of Advent of Code. These solutions are not entirely optimized for time and space, they are mostly first attempts at cracking the problem that takes a reasonable time to run and generate the results.
