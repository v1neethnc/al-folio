## What is DWITE
-----
[DWITE](dwite.org) (Do-While-If-Then-Else) was a Canadian programming contest for school students. It ran for a little over a decade, after which it was discontinued. I do not remember how I came across the contest, but I started digging through the archives because they made for fun problem solving practice, which I sorely needed to get back into brushing up my data structures and algorithms concepts.

## Information
-----
All my solutions are written in Python. At the time of writing these solutions, the version I'm using is Python 3.7. The solutions are organized by editions, with each edition getting its own separate folder. Each edition contains three folders: problem statements, problem inputs, solution codes.
